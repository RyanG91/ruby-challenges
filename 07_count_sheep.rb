# Count Sheep

# Given an integer such as 3, return a string with:
# "1 sheep...2 sheep...3 sheep". Input will always be valid,
# no negative integers.

# Test your solution with ruby tests/07_count_sheep_test.rb


# Beast Mode:
# Try adding your own tests and see if they pass for example,
# a test for when "n" is 0.
