# Sum Numbers

# Write a method that will take an array of numbers,
# and return their sum.

# Example:
# sum_numbers([1,1,1]) should return 3
# sum_numbers([5,2,100,0,10]) should return 117

# Check your solution by running the tests:
# ruby tests/04_sum_numbers_test.rb

def sum_numbers (numbers)
  # Your code here
end
