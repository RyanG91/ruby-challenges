# Combine Hashes

# Write a method which will take two different hashes and will
# return their combined value in a new hash.

# Example:
# hash1 = { a: 3, b: 5, c: 1}
# hash2 = { a: 5, b: 2, c: 14}

# combine_hashes => { a: 8, b: 7, c: 15 }

# Test your solution with ruby tests/17_combine_hashes.rb

def combine_hashes(hash1, hash2)
  hash3 = {}

  # Your code here

  return hash3
end
